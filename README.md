Classifying the fashion models using deep learning

Problem statement:

Zalando's article images with a dimension of 28x28 which are grayscales.The images are associated with 10 different classes. Our aim is to classify the images.

Description :

The dataset contains the images of articles in the form of pixel values and its labels in target variable.

class labels ---> 0:t-shirt/top, 1:trouser, 2:pullover, 3:dress, 4:coat, 5:sandal, 6:shirt, 7:sneaker, 8:bag, 9:ankle boot

We have to classify the images on test data after training the model using the train data. For implementing this i am using deep learning methodology.

Tasks perfromed :

1) Read the dataset & EDA analysis on the dataset

2) building the sequential model

3) evaluation of model on test data based on accuracy metrics

4) checking the predicted labels are matching the original test images using plot
